First of all I visited the API website alphavantage registered and got an API key.
Then I read a little bit through the documentation to find out which API link I need.
Now I opened Python and started to write my script.
I imported a module called requests and wrote a function called: "get_stock_quotes".
Now I put the API url from alphavantage into a variable that I called url and I made some changes for example:
adding my api key and the name of the equity.
Now I added the url to the module requests function to load the data into a JSON file which makes everything look sorted and accessible
in lists and dictionaries to pick the important data out.
I picked the important data out and put everything into different variables. 
When I had all of the data I needed. I put every variable into one variable called: "complete_data"
and formatted everything so its looks organized and sorted. 
In the end I call the function and the expected output shows in the Interpreter/Commandline.
